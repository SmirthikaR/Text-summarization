# Text-summarization
Text summarization is the process of condensing a large amount of text into a shorter version while preserving the essential information and main ideas. There are two primary approaches to text summarization:

Extractive Summarization: This method involves selecting key sentences or phrases directly from the original text to create a summary. It focuses on identifying the most important parts of the text without altering the original wording.

Abstractive Summarization: In this approach, the system generates a summary by understanding the main ideas of the text and rephrasing them in a more concise manner. It often involves natural language generation techniques, making the summary more coherent and human-like.
